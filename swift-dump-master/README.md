# swift-dump

swift-dump by Kim Jong-Cracks is a rewrite of the original swift-dump by neonichu (https://github.com/neonichu/swift-dump)
swift-dump is currently highly experimental, and you'll need to modify the generated classes for it them to compile!

## Usage
``` swift-dump [binary ```

## TODO
* Support structs
* Support complex output types eg: ```LyftUI.TextField.validators.setter : [(input : Swift.String) -> Swift.Bool]```
