Revolved
========

This is the complete source code of [Revolved](http://revolvedapp.com) – the 3D modelling app for the iPad that I've developed last summer.

## Why?

There were many reasons for making Revolved open-sourced – [some internal](https://twitter.com/BCiechanowski/status/488649036250238977), [some external](https://twitter.com/BCiechanowski/status/487272741171908608), but it nonetheless feels like the perfect time to share the source code with the rest of the world. I strongly believe in giving back, as I've personally learned so much [from others](https://github.com/lemnar/Molecules).

Revolved is *no longer under development*, but I'd be more than happy if its source helped making your app better.

## Features

- OpenGL ES 2.0 based rendering integrated with UIKit
- custom animation engine
- a bit of private API hackery

The line drawing system has been [explained in details on my blog](http://ciechanowski.me/blog/2014/02/18/drawing-bezier-curves/).

## License

Revolved source code is released under the [BSD 3-Clause License](https://github.com/Ciechan/Revolved/blob/master/LICENSE). You're free to use/copy/rewrite whatever pieces of code you desire. However, this license **does not cover the image assets** – you can't reuse them in your app. While I don't care that much for the PNGs, this is intended to prevent blatant resubmission of Revolved to the AppStore without a slightest alteration.
