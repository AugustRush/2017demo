#ARPhysics

ARPhysics is a real-time 2D rigid-body physics library, written by me as my final-year Computer Science undergraduate project while at the University of Plymouth. 
It takes the form of a static library that can be linked in any other project. It is written using standard C++11 so it can be complied for any platform using a compliant compiler.
